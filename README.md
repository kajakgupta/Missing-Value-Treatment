Prevention and handling of missing data 

## Missing Value Treatment
Missing values in data is a common phenomenon in real world problems. Knowing how to handle missing values effectively is a required step to reduce bias and to produce powerful models. In this model pandas.DataFrame.fillna() method is used to handle the missing values.
